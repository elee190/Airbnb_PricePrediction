# Airbnb_PricePrediction

In this project, I grab the data from http://data.insideairbnb.com/the-netherlands/north-holland/amsterdam/2021-04-09/data/listings.csv.gz and try to predict Airbnb listing prices for units in Amsterdam. Rather than data mining,the primaryfocus of this project is to demonstrate my Python skills in data wrangling and manipulation, including imputing null values, converting data columns to appropriate data type to save memory, feature engineering, and running regressiong with OLS method.
